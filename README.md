## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with Fitness Tracking app that logged workouts and exercises to a Mongo database.

Starting out I was provided with some starter code for the front end which was very helpful.  My struggles really started with MongoDB and Mongoose as I didn't fully understand them from the previous weeks lessons. After working with some classmates I was able to get the database connected to the app which was a great start.  Then I struggled with getting the routes set up properly but eventually realized I was making a careless error and not aligning the route properly to the server.  Overall I think it ended up coming out well.
